# reusable-workflow-pipeline

A library of reusable workflows for GitHub Actions workflows in other repositories to clone and then call.

## Notes

- this is an experiment
- this is a library
- Secrets stored in this repository are not accessible from the reusable workflow library files.  Because the workflows run in other repositories, not this one.

## Support

- To use this repo we ask that you make your repo InnerSource.  That way other teams can learn from you, and you can learn from other teams.
- Support is to be done by leaving issues on this repo.  But if the support requires troubleshooting a problem, then you will be asked to share your repository.
- You are invited to send pull requests to modify or add reusable workflows.  Especially if they are something that could be reusable.  See the contributing.md instructions before sending a pull request.
